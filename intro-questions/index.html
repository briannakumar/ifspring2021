        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p> 1. I'm Brianna Kumar, a junior majoring in Marketing and Communication Design. </p>
        <p> 2. Studying marketing and communication design has prompted me to question how I can blend research, strategy, and design in my work. I recently started exploring UX/UI design and I'm hoping this class will help me learn some foundational html and css skills. </p>
        <p> 3. I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I'm excited to learn more this semester!  </p>
        <p> 4. I'd like to learn more about the intersection of design and technology that I can apply to my future work. </p>
        <p> 5. I think accessibility and legibility will be a larger focus to ensure the user experience is intuitive. </p>
        <p> 6. <A HREF="https://www.ogilvy.com/">Ogilvy's</A> website exemplifies effective design by representing their company's mission through bold typography and color palette. The interactivity also makes for an engaging experience. </p>
        <p> 7. <A HREF="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker's</A> website exemplifies effective communication by using clear hierarchy. The design does a good job of managing a lot of content by using clear levels of typographic hierarchy to call attention to article titles and sections.</p>
        <p> 8. <A HREF="https://www.southwest.com/">Southwest's</A> website works well as the user is able to accomplish their primary task right away. Most users probably return to the website to book a new flight, check in, or check their flight status. All of these functions are easily accomplished without having to struggle with navigation.  </p>
