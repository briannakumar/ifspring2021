                <h3>1. YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, USA</h3>
                <p>
                    There is hardly another climbing area in the world with as much history as Yosemite. Climbers used to call it the “Centre of the Universe.” Indeed, they were right. For generations, the world’s best climbers used to make the legendary Camp 4 their home. They would refer to themselves as “The Stone Monkeys” and spend their days either climbing or planning their next climbing feat. The love affair between climbers and Yosemite is, of course, not without good reason. Climbers love rock, and Yosemite offers a sea of incredible granite, with breathtakingly beautiful nature to boot. It’s some of the best granite you will ever find anywhere. The only problem is that it’s darn hard to climb on. Be ready to tackle microscopic footholds and smooth rock faces interrupted with splitter cracks of all widths and sizes.

                <h3>2. KALYMNOS, GREECE</h3>
                    Is there anything better than a perfect overhang, scattered with beautifully sculptured tufas, hiding all kinds of sport climbing trickery, like knee bars, deep drop knees, heel hooks and toe hooks? If you share my vision of a perfect sport climbing route, Kalymnos is the ‘X’ on your treasure map. If you don’t share my vision, climb there anyways! The area is full of hidden climbing treasures. Kalymnos’ pumpy overhanging mega pitches are the island’s main dish, and its 3,400+ routes, ranging from slabs to roofs, are plenty to satiate any climber. Kalymnos’ Aegean setting and its dry, Mediterranean climate makes climbing possible throughout the year. Autumn is the best and most popular season for climbing, with October being the month where the number of climbers peaks, so keep that in mind when planning your trip. If you choose to go in October, you may want to avoid Odyssey, Grande Grotta, Arhi and Spartacus, as they are the most popular and most crowded spots.
                    <h4>“With well-bolted crags and a wide variety of grades, the climbing in Kalymnos is accessible for climbers of all abilities.”</h4>

                    <h3>3. DOLOMITES, ITALY</h3>
                    If you dream about a proper alpine climbing experience, Dolomites are a place to go. What Yosemite is to the US climbing scene, the Dolomites is that for Europe — a proving ground for generations of climbers and one of the best places in the world for alpine climbing. While most climbs are slabby and vertical, there are some serious overhangs, such as the great roof of Cima Ovest. Climbing here is indeed amazing, but for me, what set the Dolomites apart from the rest of the places I ‘ve visited is the landscape. It’s fairytale-like. Green fields full of colorful flowers, the backdrop of the mighty snow-capped mountains, the omnipresent soothing of softly jingling cowbells. Whatever the Dolomites take in the form of challenging and often scary climbing, they give back every time you remember to look around away from the rock.

                    <h4>“With a longer approach and fewer climbers, the Andrich route on the Torre Venezia , is one of the great spots for crack climbing in the Dolomites.”</h4>
