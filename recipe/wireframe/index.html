                <p>1/2 cup dutch process cocoa</p>
                <p>1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
                <p>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</p>
                <p>3 large brown bananas</p>
                <p>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</p>
                <p>1/4 cup canola vegetable oil</p>
                <p>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</p>
                <p>1 large egg</p>

            <div class="instructions">
                <h2>Instructions</h3>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Heat your oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.</p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Set aside.</p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork. Add the melted butter and oil and stir until combined. Stir in the brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth.</p>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, don’t overmix. Stir in ¾ cup of the chocolate chips.</p>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup of chocolate chips over the top of the bread. Bake for 50-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out mostly clean, you might have some melted chocolate chips on the toothpick and that is fine. You just don’t want a lot of gooey batter. Check at 50 minutes, just to be safe. Oven times vary.</p>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack. Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the bread and carefully remove from the pan. Let the bread cool on the wire cooling rack until slightly warm. Cut into slices and serve.</p>
                <h3>Step 7</h3>
                <p>Note-the bread will keep on the counter, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 4 days. This bread also freezes well. To freeze, cool the bread completely and wrap in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost before slicing.</p>
